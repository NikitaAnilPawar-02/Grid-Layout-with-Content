# Grid Layout Practice Project

This project showcases a CSS Grid layout with 17 numbered blocks inside a bordered container. Each block contains different content like images, text, videos, forms, tables, maps, and more. The layout is designed to be clear, with distinct colors and borders to separate each block. This assignment helped practice arranging diverse content using CSS Grid while keeping the design clean and functional.
